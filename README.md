# Taxi Congestion and Cost Predictions using Machine Learning
*(NOTE: I am in the process of moving this to a functional site, demonstrating the project and allowing users to insert their own pickup and drop-off locations, and comparing them to any real-world example of taxi costs for specific or similar trips.)*

## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops predictive models for **New York City taxi trip costs and congestion patterns** using machine learning. Leveraging the **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) trip records** from **January 2025**, the goal was to design, evaluate, and compare models capable of providing accurate taxi fare predictions while exploring congestion trends.  

This project was completed as my **Final Project for CSCI-497: AI & Data Science (Machine Learning) at Texas A&M University - Commerce**. I received a **100% grade**.

## 🎯 Objectives and Problem Statement
- **Problem:** Taxi fares in NYC are unpredictable due to distance, time of day, congestion, and surcharges.  
- **Objective:** Build a predictive pipeline that can:  
  - Estimate **total taxi cost** given trip details.  
  - Analyze **congestion and demand patterns** using location and time features.  
- **Why it matters:** Such a model can help **passengers estimate fares**, **drivers optimize routes**, and **city planners analyze congestion** trends.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Source:** [NYC TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)  
- **Timeframe:** January 2025 yellow taxi trips  
- **Size:** 1,048,575 entries  
- **Target Variable:** `total_amount` (final fare including surcharges, fees, tolls, etc.)  
- **Key Features:**  
  - `tpep_pickup_datetime`, `tpep_dropoff_datetime` (timestamps)  
  - `PULocationID`, `DOLocationID` (pickup/dropoff zones)  
  - `trip_distance`  
  - `fare_amount`, `extra`, `mta_tax`, `tip_amount`, `tolls_amount`, `congestion_surcharge`, `airport_fee`  
  - `passenger_count`, `payment_type`  

---

## 🔄 Methods and Pipeline
The full ML workflow included:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Dropped duplicates and missing entries.  
   - Removed invalid or refunded trips (`total_amount < 0`).  
   - Outlier removal using **IQR filtering** (to eliminate extreme trip distances, fares, or incorrect entries).  

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Dropped irrelevant fields (`VendorID`, `store_and_fwd_flag`, `payment_type`, `tip_amount`).  
   - Encoded categorical features (`RateCodeID`, pickup/dropoff IDs).  
   - Time-based features extracted (hour, day, weekday).  
   - Normalized skewed numeric features (`trip_distance`, `fare_amount`, `total_amount`) with **StandardScaler**.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Histograms, scatterplots, and correlation matrices revealed:
     - **Right-skewed trip distances and fares** (many short trips, few very long ones).  
     - **Strong correlation between trip distance and fare amount.**  
     - **Congestion surcharge consistently added** since NYC implemented it city-wide.  
     - Some features like `tolls_amount` were mostly zero and dropped.  

4. **Modeling**
   - **Baseline Models:** Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge.  
   - **Tree-based Models:** Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting.  
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, R² (scikit-learn).

## 📈 Model Results and Comparison
| Model                  | RMSE   | MAE   | R²   |
|-------------------------|--------|-------|------|
| Linear Regression       | ~4.95  | ~3.70 | 0.83 |
| Ridge Regression        | ~4.90  | ~3.65 | 0.84 |
| Random Forest Regressor | ~3.75  | ~2.85 | 0.91 |
| Gradient Boosting       | **3.40** | **2.60** | **0.93** |

➡️ **Gradient Boosting performed best**, reducing error rates significantly over baselines.
